Given the following ALCO Description Logic ontology:

O = {
{alc} ⊔ {alco} ⊔ {alcou} ⊑ ∃hasOperator.DLOperator ⊓ ¬∃hasOperator.MLOperator,
{ml} ⊔ {mln} ⊔ {mlnu} ⊑ ∃hasOperator.MLOperator ⊓ ¬∃hasOperator.DLOperator,
{alc} ⊔ {ml} ⊑ EnjoysCIP,
EnjoysCIP ⊑ EnjoysPBDP,
EnjoysPBDP ⊑ EnjoysBDP,
{alcou} ⊔ {mlnu} ⊑ EnjoysBDP ⊓ ¬EnjoysPBDP,
{alco} ⊔ {mln} ⊑ ¬EnjoysBDP
}

and the following dataset:

D = { }

provide an ALCO Description Logic concept C that strongly separates the positive examples:

E+ = {alc}

from the negative examples:

E− = {alco, alcou, ml, mln, mlnu}

meaning that

(O, D) |= C(alc)

whereas

(O, D) |= ¬C(d)

for every d ∈ E−
