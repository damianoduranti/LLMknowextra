Using only the propositional letter "r", can you provide an LTL formula that is satisfied on these traces:

TRACE 1

1. { r }
2. { r }
3. { r }
4. { r, p }
5. { r }
6. { r, q }
7. { r }
8. { r }
9. { r }

TRACE 2

1. { r , p, q}
2. { r }
3. { r }
4. { r }
5. { r }
6. { r, p, q }
7. { r }
8. { r }
9. { r, p, q}

To create an LTL formula using only the propositional letter "r" that is satisfied on the provided traces, you can use the following formula:

G(r && X(r))

Explanation:

    G(r): This part ensures that "r" (r holds) is globally true at all time steps in both provided traces.
    X(r): This part ensures that "r" holds in the next state, which ensures that "r" continues to hold in consecutive states.

This formula captures the condition that "r" must continuously hold in the given traces, which matches the behavior described in TRACE 1 and TRACE 2.

Please note that the formula does not specify the behavior of "p" and "q," as you requested an LTL formula using only the propositional letter "r."
