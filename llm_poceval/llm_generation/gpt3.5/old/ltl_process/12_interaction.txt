Using only the propositional letter "r", can you provide an LTL formula that is satisfied on these traces:

TRACE 3

1. { r }
2. { r }
3. { }
4. { r, p }
5. { r }
6. { r, q }
7. { }
8. { r }
9. { r }

TRACE 4

1. { p}
2. { p }
3. { }
4. { p }
5. {  }
6. { q }
7. { }
8. { p }
9. { p }

To create an LTL formula using only the propositional letter "r" that is satisfied on TRACE 3 and TRACE 4 while being falsified on the other provided traces, you can use the following formula:

G(r) && F(¬X(r))

Explanation:

    G(r): This part ensures that "r" (r holds) is globally true at all time steps in TRACE 3 and TRACE 4.
    F(¬X(r)): This part specifies that it is not the case that "r" will hold in the next state. This condition is satisfied in TRACE 3 and TRACE 4 because, in both cases, there are states where "r" doesn't hold in the next state.

This formula captures the specific behavior of TRACE 3 and TRACE 4 where "r" is initially true but doesn't hold in the next state. It is falsified on the other traces where "r" continues to hold in consecutive states.
