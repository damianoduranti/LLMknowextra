Given the following Description Logic ontology:

O = {
EuUni ⊔ OcUni ⊑ Uni ,
∃studiesAt.Uni ⊑ Student,
∃studiesAt.{uniVi} ⊑ ¬∃studiesAt.EuUni
}

and the following dataset:

D={
studiesAt(eugenio, uniBo),
studiesAt (giovanna, uniVi),
studiesAt(guido, uniSi),
EuUni(uniBo),
EuUni(uniSi),
OcUni(uniVi),
Student(eugenio),
Student(guido)
}

can you provide a Description Logic concept C that distinguishes the positive examples:

E+ ={eugenio,guido}

from the negative examples:

E− ={giovanna}

meaning that

(O, D) |= C(eugenio)

and

(O, D) |= C(guido)

whereas

(O, D) |= ¬C(giovanna)

To distinguish the positive examples (E+) from the negative examples (E-), you can define a Description Logic concept C as follows:

C = ∃studiesAt.Uni ⊓ Student

Explanation:

    ∃studiesAt.Uni: This part of the concept indicates that there exists a relationship "studiesAt" with a "Uni."
    Student: This part of the concept specifies that the individual is a "Student."

This concept C effectively distinguishes individuals who are students at a university (positive examples) from those who are not (negative examples).

In the provided dataset D:

    For eugenio, (O, D) |= C(eugenio) because eugenio is a Student and studies at a University (uniBo).
    For giovanna, (O, D) |= ¬C(giovanna) because giovanna is not a Student.

So, C successfully distinguishes E+ from E- according to your criteria.
