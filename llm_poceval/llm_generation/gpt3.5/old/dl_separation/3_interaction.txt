Can you provide a separating concept that uses only EuUni?

ChatGPT

To provide a separating concept using only "EuUni," you can define the concept as follows:

C = ∃studiesAt.EuUni

This concept indicates that there exists a relationship "studiesAt" with the class EuUni. It effectively distinguishes individuals who study at EuUni (E+) from those who do not (E-).

In the provided dataset:

    For eugenio and guido, (O, D) |= C(eugenio) and (O, D) |= C(guido) because they both study at EuUni (uniBo and uniSi).
    For giovanna, (O, D) |= ¬C(giovanna) because she does not study at EuUni.

This concept C successfully distinguishes E+ from E- based on the provided dataset, focusing on the "EuUni" concept.
