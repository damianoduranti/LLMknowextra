The answer you provided is not correct. The provided LTL formula

G(r ∧ (X¬r))

is not satisfied by the first trace.

Provide another formula, using only the propositional letter "r".

I apologize for the oversight. Here's another LTL formula:

F(r∧G(¬r))

This formula reads as "eventually, rr holds, and globally, rr does not hold."

On the first trace:

    At state 1, rr holds, satisfying the formula.

On the second trace:

    At state 1, rr holds, but at state 7, rr does not hold, which satisfies the formula since rr does not hold globally in subsequent states.
