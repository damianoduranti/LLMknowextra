The answer you provided is not correct. The provided LTL formula

F(r ∧ G(¬r))

is not satisfied by the first trace.

Provide another formula, using only the propositional letter "r".

I apologize for the oversight. Here's another LTL formula:

F(r∧X(¬r))

This formula reads as "eventually, rr holds, and in the next state, rr does not hold."

On the first trace:

    At state 1, rr holds, and in the next state (2), rr does not hold.
    This pattern continues in subsequent states.

On the second trace:

    At state 1, rr holds, but in the next state (2), rr still holds, falsifying the formula.
