The answer you provided is not correct. The provided LTL formula

G(r → X(q → Xp))

is not satisfied by the first trace.

Provide another formula.

GPT3.5 Answer 2 (incorrect on TRACE1)

I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct that. If we want to express the property "p eventually holds after q," the correct LTL formula should be:

LTL Formula: G(r→F(q∧Xp))

Explanation:

    G: Global, meaning the entire trace.
    r→F(q∧Xp): If rr holds, then eventually (F), there exists a state where q holds, and in the next state (X), p holds.

This formula states that whenever r holds, eventually there will be a state where q holds, and in the next state, p will hold.

I appreciate your patience, and I hope this formula aligns with your requirements.
