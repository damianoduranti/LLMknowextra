The answer you provided is not correct. The provided LTL formula

G(r → F(q → Fp))

is not satisfied by the first trace.

Provide another formula.

GPT3.5 Answer 4 (incorrect on TRACE1)

I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct that. If we want to express the property "p eventually holds after q," the correct LTL formula should be:

LTL Formula: G(r→Xq→X(Fp))

Explanation:

    G: Global, meaning the entire trace.
    r→Xq→X(Fp): If r holds, then in the next state (X), q holds, and in the state after that (X), p eventually (F) holds.

I appreciate your understanding, and I hope this formula addresses your requirements.
