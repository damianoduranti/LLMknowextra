The answer you provided is not correct. The provided LTL formula

G(r → F(q ∧ Xp))

is not satisfied by the first trace.

Provide another formula.

GPT3.5 Answer 3 (incorrect on TRACE1)

I apologize for the confusion. If we want to express the property "p eventually holds after q," the correct LTL formula should be:

LTL Formula: G(r→F(q→Fp))

Explanation:

    G: Global, meaning the entire trace.
    r→F(q→Fp): If r holds, then eventually (F), if q holds, then eventually p will hold.

I appreciate your patience, and I hope this formula aligns with your requirements.
