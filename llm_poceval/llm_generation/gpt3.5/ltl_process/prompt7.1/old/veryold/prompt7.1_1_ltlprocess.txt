Provide an LTL formula, using only the propositional letters "p" and "q", that is satisfied on the following trace:

1. { p }
2. { p }
3. { p }
4. { p }
5. { p }
6. { q }
7. { r }
8. { r }
9. { r }

and falsified on the following trace:

1. { p }
2. { p }
3. { p }
4. { p }
5. { }
6. { q }
7. { r }
8. { r }
9. { r }


%%% EXPECTED ANSWER: p U q -- "Eventually, p until q"

G(p → Fq)

GPT3.5 Answer (old conversation -- Answer 1, Prompt 7 conversation)

Certainly, an LTL formula that captures the properties you described could be:

F(p∧X(q))

This formula asserts that it's always in the future (eventually, denoted by F) that p is true, and the next state (X) after that q is true. This holds for the first trace where q appears after p and is not satisfied in the second trace where q appears but not immediately after p.

GPT3.5 Answer (Answer 1, new conversation; prompt misunderstood)

For the trace where the formula should be satisfied:

F(p∧G(q))

Explanation:

  * F denotes "finally," meaning that at some point in the future, the proposition inside the parentheses will be true.
  * G denotes "globally," meaning that the proposition inside the parentheses is true for all future states.

So, the formula states that eventually, pp will be true, and from that point onwards, q will always be true.

For the trace where the formula should be falsified:

F(p∧G(¬q))

Explanation:

  * ¬ denotes negation.
  * This formula states that eventually, pp will be true, and from that point onwards, qq will not always be true.
