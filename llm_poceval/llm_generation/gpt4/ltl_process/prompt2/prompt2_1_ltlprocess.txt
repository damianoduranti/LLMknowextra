(CORRECT)

To find an LTL formula that is satisfied by the first two traces and falsified by the last two, we need to identify a pattern that is common to Trace 1 and Trace 2 but not in Trace 3 and Trace 4.

Looking at the traces, we can see the following:

- Trace 1 and Trace 2 both have `r` in every step of the trace.
- Trace 3 is missing `r` at step 7.
- Trace 4 is missing `r` at steps 3 and 7.

Given these observations, we can immediately determine that the presence of `r` at every step is necessary for the formula to be satisfied, which points to the `G` operator for global consistency. However, since Trace 4 always has `p` when `r` is missing, we must ensure that the formula does not become true if `p` is present without `r`.

Thus, the LTL formula that will be satisfied by Trace 1 and Trace 2 and falsified by Trace 3 and Trace 4 is:

\[ G(r) \]

This formula states that `r` must always be true in every step of the trace. It is satisfied by Trace 1 and Trace 2, where `r` is indeed present at every step, and falsified by Trace 3 and Trace 4, where `r` is missing at one or more steps.

The presence of `p` alongside `r` or in the absence of `r` in Trace 2 and Trace 4 does not affect the satisfaction of the formula \( G(r) \) because the formula only specifies a requirement for `r` and does not make any assertions about `p`.
