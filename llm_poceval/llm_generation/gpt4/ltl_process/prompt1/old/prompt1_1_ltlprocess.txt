In Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), we can describe properties of paths in a model where the formula is evaluated. To provide an LTL formula that is satisfied by the first trace and falsified by the second trace, we should look for a property that differentiates the two.

Let's analyze the two traces:

Satisfied trace:
1. { r }
2. { r }
3. { r }
4. { r, p }
5. { r }
6. { r, q }
7. { r }
8. { r }
9. { r }

Falsified trace:
1. { r }
2. { r }
3. { r }
4. { r, p }
5. { r }
6. { r, q }
7. { }
8. { r }
9. { r }

The key difference between the traces is at step 7, where the falsified trace does not contain `r`. This suggests that the LTL formula must require `r` to be always true, which is indicated by the `G` (Globally) operator in LTL.

Therefore, the LTL formula that would be satisfied by the first trace and falsified by the second trace is:
```
G(r)
```
This formula states that `r` must be true at all points in the trace. It is satisfied by the first trace, where `r` is indeed true in every state, and falsified by the second trace, where `r` is not true at the 7th state.
