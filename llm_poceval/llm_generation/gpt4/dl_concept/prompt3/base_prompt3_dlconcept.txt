Given the following ALC Description Logic ontology:

O = {
∃competesIn.PremierLeague ⊑ Footballclub,
∃competesIn.Bundesliga ⊑ ¬∃competesIn.PremierLeague
}

and the following dataset:

D = {
competesIn(c1, b),
competesIn(c2, b),
competesIn(c3, p),
competesIn(c4, p),
Bundesliga(b),
PremierLeague(p),
Footballclub(c1),
Footballclub(c2)
}

provide an ALC Description Logic concept C that strongly separates the positive examples:

E+ = {c1, c2}

from the negative examples:

E− = {c3, c4}

meaning that

(O, D) |= C(c1)

and

(O, D) |= C(c2)

whereas

(O, D) |= ¬C(c3)

and

(O, D) |= ¬C(c4)
